# Instructions  

For this coding exercise, you will first run learn more about operations performed on data types. Then, you will continue working on manipulating your Spotify playlist.

Your Spotify playlist is a type of list. Here is the learning outcomes for this exercise:
  1. Add elements to a list.
  2. Eliminate elements from a list.
  3. Print using f-strings

## Steps
No.| To do
:-:|:-
1| In "main.py", do not change anything. Leave as is. 
2| In "operations.py", you will find a short exercise on data types, operators that you can do with integers and floats (both numerical types of data), and typecasting (converting 1 data type into another type). All the codes in this file are actually all good to go--after you run in your whole code in the end (after finishing exitticket1.py), just make sure to check your output to write down your answers to the questions via comments (using # in the beginning of the code line).
3| In "exitticket1.py", you will manipulate your Spotify playlist even more. Just like before, you first need to add the songs to your playlist starting in line 5.
4| In line 15, list what number you should add in the index (inside the square backets " [ ] " ) in the next line to access the first song in the list.
5| In line 18, you can create a variable of your favorite song by indexing it from the playlist, then printing a concatenation of a string and the value in an output. Concatenation is when you combine variables with strings.
6| In line 22, see how to use f-strings. You will be using this a few more times in this exercise.
7| In line 28, indicate the artist who sings your favorite song from the list. Remember to store it as a string element. You will then print this.
8| In line 32-33, you will save the same message that you printed in Step 7, except you will create an f-string to do it. Refer to line 23 (Step 6) on how to write this out.
9| In lines 39-40, you will do the similar thing in Step 8.
10| In line 44, you will find the length of the list. In line 47, you will print it.
11| In line 53, you will change the first song in your playlist to "Yay Area" then print it.
12| In line 62, you will add a song ("Purple Hearts") to the end of the playlist using append().
13| In line 67, you will then delete this song using pop().
14| In line 72, you will add a song ("Moscow Mule") to the beginning of the playlist using insert().
15| In line 76, you will pop the new song ("Purple Hearts") while adding it to a new playlist. Afterwards, print both lists.
16| In lines 81-83, you will read some words of affirmation!
17| In line 86, you will add "Yay Area" again to the playlist. Refer to line 72 (but this time, it doesn't matter where you add it to the list).
18| In line 94-95, you will remove a song ("Yay Area") from playlist but add it to the a new variable "yay_song" then print this new list as well as the playlist. In line 99, you will print an f-string.
19| In line 102, you will sort the playlist in alphabetical order & then print it out. In line 106, write the output of the songs in alphabetical order.
20| After running your code and checking everything in both main.py and exitticket1.py, go to the Version Control icon on the leftmost sidebar & send commit to Github.
